  ASNeG aims to provide an open source platform which helps people to integrate
  their devices and services into the unified infrastructure based on OPC UA technology.
  For this goal, we are developing many things such as a C++ client\server SDK, an application server,
  an OPC UA client, a GUI designer and so on. All this software is open source and free.
