Hi everyone,

We are more than happy to announce that our OPC UA Stack 3.8.1 has been released. We've fixed some critical bugs.
[One](https://github.com/ASNeG/OpcUaStack/issues/314) of them didn't allow to install the stack on new Ubuntu distributives. Now it works perfect! 

For more details about the release [see](https://github.com/ASNeG/OpcUaStack/releases/tag/3.8.1).
