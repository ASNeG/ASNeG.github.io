Hi everyone,

we support project [ASNeG-Demo](https://github.com/ASNeG/ASNeG-Demo) to give our
users examples of all significant function of [the stack](/projects/opcuastack).
It is an application which is generated by the stack and runs with
its application server.

Now we have added the project on the website so that you can get some information and
news about it.
